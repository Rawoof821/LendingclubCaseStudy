## General Information
- This case study analyzes a consumer finance company specializing in lending diverse types of loans to urban customers.
- The primary objective is to identify predictive patterns and factors that indicate the likelihood of loan default. 
- These insights will help form strategic decisions such as denying loans, reducing loan amounts, or adjusting interest rates for higher-risk applicants.
- The data set given is a csv file with the loan data for the Lending Club.

  

## Conclusions
#### Factors that can be used to predict the chance of defaulting are:
#### Home Ownership
Homeowners with mortgages or renters face increased default risks when taking on additional loans due to their existing financial obligations, potentially straining their debt-to-income ratios amid fluctuating incomes.
#### States
Higher number of defaulted loans belonged to big states like California, New York and Florida.
#### Employement Length
Majority of charged off loans belonged to clients having 10+ years of experience.
#### Purpose
Loans given for small bussiness were most defaulted.
#### DTI (Debt to Income ratio)
A significant number of individuals had a high debt-to-income ratio, indicating challenges in managing loan repayments alongside existing financial commitments, possibly resulting in defaults due to stretched financial capacity.
#### Late fees
People with history of late fee payment will have 43% chance of becoming a defaulter.
#### Grades and Sub grades
People with grades G and F and sub-grades F5, G2,G3,G5 are more probable to be defaulters.
#### Term and Interest rate
Loans that were charged off usually had higher interest rates, indicating riskier loan terms. Additionally, a greater percentage of loans with a 3-year (36-month) term defaulted compared to those with a 5-year (60-month) term, likely because shorter terms lead to higher monthly payments, affecting borrower affordability and repayment capability.
#### Bankruptcies
40% of borrowers with 2 bankruptcies are defaulters.
